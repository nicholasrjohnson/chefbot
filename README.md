# raspberrytalk
This partictular project is a way to learn Python scripting on Raspberry Pis, have AI bots interact with each other, use Google's APIs, and to have fun all around.
I am implementing this on two Raspberry Pi 4Bs with two Seeed Respeaker 2 Audio HATs and some robot speakers. It will be a smaller undertaking as far as how much code (at least I would assume so!!)
Therefore, I will probably be spending some time on this soonish. I need to keep up with technology anyways. This kind of idea is something that not everyone has thought of IMHO.

The project will use character.ai and an interface to it in Python to have multiple characters talking with one another. Seems pretty cool!
